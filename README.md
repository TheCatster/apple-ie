## Overview

Apple Ie is a pet project Apple I emulator written in Rust. It allows you to run Apple I software on your modern MacBook, eventually accurately. As a university student I don't have the greatest time to dedicate to this project, but I am working on it opcode-by-opcode.

## Installation

To install Apple Ie, clone the repository and run the following command:

```rs
cargo build --release
```

This will create an executable file called `apple-ie`.

## Usage

To run Apple Ie, simply execute the `apple-ie` file. This will run a test program. If you include a correct assembly file as an argument, Apple Ie will run it instead.

In the future, you will be prompted to select an Apple I ROM file. Once you have selected a ROM file, Apple Ie will start the emulation.
